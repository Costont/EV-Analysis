## Summary
  California’s proposed ZEV program rule puts into motion an executive order that Gov. Gavin Newsom issued in 2020. Under the plan, 35 percent of new cars and light trucks sold must be zero-emissions starting in 2026. That will increase to 68 percent in 2030, and to 100 percent in 2035. The plan allows for 20 percent of new sales to be plug-in hybrids. Can these goals be met with California’s current charging station infrastructure?

  States and counties with more EV charging stations have more EV vehicles registered. It can be assumed that there are more EV purchases in those states and counties.
  
### Overview
  
  Electric vehicle charge station infrastructure is key to the ZEV program’s success.
  
    •	EV Charging Station ratios
    •	How many miles do you have to drive to a charge station?
    •	The ratio of charging stations to electric vehicles 
    •	EV charge stations by county
    •	Number of EV cars by county
